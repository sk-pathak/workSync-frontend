# Design Considerations:
- *Color Palette:* A clean and modern palette that aligns with your website’s branding. Use color contrasts for important CTAs, like a bright CTA button for Join Project or Create Task.
- *Typography:* Use a sans-serif font for headings and a serif or easy-to-read sans-serif font for body text. Make sure headings are bold and sizes vary according to importance.
- *Whitespace:* Maintain plenty of whitespace between sections for a clutter-free, digestible experience.
- *Responsive Design:* Ensure the page is mobile-friendly with a collapsible side menu and easily scrollable sections.
- *Microinteractions:* Add hover effects, button animations, or progress animations (e.g., when a task is completed or a milestone is reached).

# Bonus Features:
- *Dark Mode Option:* Allow users to toggle between light and dark mode for personalization.
- *Customizable Alerts:* Enable users to set up custom notifications for project updates, task changes, and team messages.
